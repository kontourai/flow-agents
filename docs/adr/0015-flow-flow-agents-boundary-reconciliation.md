# ADR 0015: Flow / Flow Agents Boundary Reconciliation

**Date:** 2026-06-25
**Status:** Accepted. Tier 0 (#175) shipped; Tier 1 (#176) closed-by-evaluation (+ a found anti-gaming fix, #196); Tier 2 (#177) **reopened and scoped** as the Resource Contract migration (the sidecar FSM IS a parallel reimplementation per ADR 0005 / #183 — see corrected Reassessment); #178/#179 are deferred cross-package work.
**Parent issue:** #174 (umbrella)

---

## Context

ADR 0001 established that Flow Agents *consumes* Flow for generic workflow enforcement
rather than owning the enforcement kernel. The boundary is owned by ADR 0001. During
Phase 4 of ADR 0010 (trust.bundle as sole verification artifact), a drift was found:
`src/cli/workflow-sidecar.ts` contained a bespoke trust-bundle schema validator
(`tryLoadHachureValidator` / `getHachureValidator` / local `validateTrustBundle`) that
duplicated logic already owned canonically by `@kontourai/surface`.

Surface's `validateTrustBundle` is the canonical owner at the lowest code layer:
hachure owns the schemas, surface owns the trust computation (including validation),
flow owns the workflow engine, flow-agents owns product adapters. The bespoke validator
was a THREE-WAY duplication of that ownership:

1. Hachure's `trust-bundle.schema.json` (the schema source of truth)
2. Surface's `validateTrustBundle` (the canonical validator, using those schemas)
3. Flow Agents' bespoke AJV + hachure-schema-loading validator (the drift)

A survey of flow-agents found that flow-agents uses approximately 1 of ~95 flow exports
(the workflow engine / gate-expectation / run-state kernel). A parallel run-state / gate
model is being reconciled through a tiered program (see below).

## Decision

### Layered ownership

```
hachure         — schemas (trust-bundle.schema.json, claim, evidence, policy, event)
surface         — trust computation: validateTrustBundle, deriveClaimStatus, resolveInquiry
flow            — workflow engine: Flow Definitions, Runs, steps, gates, transitions
flow-agents     — product/adapters: skills, hooks, sidecar writers, runtime adapters
```

Flow-agents does not own trust-bundle schema validation. Surface owns it.

### Tier 0 (this PR): consume surface's validateTrustBundle

Replaced the bespoke `tryLoadHachureValidator` / `getHachureValidator` / local
`validateTrustBundle` in `src/cli/workflow-sidecar.ts` with consumption of
`@kontourai/surface`'s canonical `validateTrustBundle`.

**Equivalence verified before swap:** surface's validator is equivalent-or-stronger than
the bespoke one — it validates the same structural constraints (required fields,
enum values, schema shape) plus cross-reference integrity (evidence → claim, event →
claim, event → evidence) that the hachure JSON schema did not enforce. All nine
test cases agreed; surface rejected two additional invalid bundles (dangling references)
that the bespoke validator accepted.

**Return shape preserved:** the public export `validateTrustBundle(bundle) →
{ valid, errors, available }` is preserved. `available` reflects surface presence (surface
is required per ADR 0010 Phase 4c; fail-open is maintained for diagnostic use). The
function became `async` because surface is ESM-only and loaded via `import()`; the call
site in `writeTrustBundle` is already async; the test inline script uses top-level await
in ES module mode.

**AJV decision:** AJV and hachure schema loading are retained for `validateInquiryRecord`
(which validates inquiry-record.schema.json — a separate schema not covered by surface's
`validateTrustBundle`). Only the trust-bundle AJV duplication was removed.

**normalizeSurfaceRefs advisory validation:** the inline advisory validation in
`normalizeSurfaceRefs` (which validates referenced trust.bundle files) was updated to use
the cached `_surfaceModule` instead of the bespoke `getHachureValidator`. Fail-open
behavior is preserved: if surface is not yet loaded when `normalizeSurfaceRefs` runs,
validation is skipped.

### Tiered reconciliation program (post Tier 0)

The broader boundary reconciliation (issue #174) is phased:

| Tier | Issue | Scope | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 0 | #175 | consume surface's `validateTrustBundle`; delete bespoke validator | **DONE** — the one genuine fork removed |
| Tier 1 | #176 | gate-expectation engine: consume flow's gate evaluation kernel | **CLOSED by evaluation** — the gate already consumes Surface (`deriveClaimStatus`) for re-derivation; residual logic is product-specific gate policy. Scoping it found+fixed a real anti-gaming regression (PR #196). |
| Tier 2 | #177 | run-state kernel → Resource Contract migration | **REOPENED AND SCOPED** — the cheap `FlowRunState` swap is still churn (original eval correct on that narrow point), but the sidecar FSM IS a parallel reimplementation of ADR 0005's Resource Contract (`state.json→WorkflowRun.status`, `acceptance.json→RunPlan.spec`, `evidence→conditions[].evidenceRefs`). The real convergence (Resource Contract + Flow Definitions, retiring the FSM, #183) is the accepted direction. Scoped as a phased migration (projection → FlowDefinition-backed advance-state → hooks → resume/evals → retire sidecars). `kits/builder/flows/build.flow.json` already exists; the FSM just doesn't consult it. |
| promotes | #178 | promote liveness / InquiryRecord / run-hook upstream | **Deferred — cross-package** (requires `flow`/`surface` source changes; not doable from this repo). |
| contracts | #179 | extract generic vocabulary to flow contracts | **Deferred — cross-package.** |

### Reassessment (post Tiers 1–2) — corrected

**An earlier version of this Reassessment was too narrow and is corrected here.** It was right that Tier 1's gate computation already consumes Surface, and that a *cheap mechanical `FlowRunState` swap* (Tier 2's original framing) would be pure churn. But it wrongly concluded the sidecar FSM is a *legitimate product-specific layer* and that the program is "essentially resolved." That misses the larger issue documented in #183:

`workflow-sidecar.ts`'s state model — the 11 phases, 13 statuses, bespoke `advanceState` guard, and per-session `state.json`/`handoff.json`/`acceptance.json`/`current.json` — **IS a parallel reimplementation of the Kontour Resource Contract (ADR 0005)** at the product level. ADR 0005 defines `WorkflowRun`/`RunPlan`/`SelectedScope`/`Gate` as the durable record shape for exactly this information; the sidecar FSM predates ADR 0005's acceptance and was never migrated. `docs/kontour-resource-contract.md`'s Compatibility Guidance already documents the mapping (`state.json→WorkflowRun.status`, `acceptance.json→RunPlan.spec`, `evidence→conditions[].evidenceRefs`, `handoff.json→WorkflowRun.status`) — i.e. it is a pre-ADR-0005 parallel implementation, not a deliberate product layer. Notably `kits/builder/flows/build.flow.json` (a Builder FlowDefinition, 10 steps / 9 gates) **already exists** — `advance-state` simply doesn't consult it.

**Corrected outcome:** Tier 0 done (the one Surface-layer fork removed); Tier 1 closed-by-evaluation (+ the #196 anti-gaming fix); **Tier 2 reopened and scoped** as a phased Builder→Resource-Contract/Flow-Definition migration (see #177): Phase 1 projection layer → Phase 2 FlowDefinition-backed `advance-state` → Phase 3 hooks → Phase 4 resume/evals → Phase 5 retire sidecars → Phase 6 Flow kernel (deferred to #178). Per #183, Builder and Knowledge are the **same** abstraction (Resource Contract over `WorkflowRun`/`Gate`), so this is a prerequisite for new kit authors to have a stable target, not optional cleanup — and the Builder migration must coordinate with the parallel Knowledge work (which already ships Flow Definitions).

**Invariant that must survive migration (#183 Finding 2):** `WorkflowRun.status.conditions` are writable summaries; the gate re-derives from Hachure claims via Surface; `conditions[].evidenceRefs` cite claim IDs. **Do not fuse Resource and claim** — the separation (a friendly mutable surface over an un-gameable derived core) is the architecture.

### Status update (2026-07-01) — Tier 2 Phase 3 landed and hardened

**Phase 3 ("hooks") of the Tier 2 migration has landed — this is not an unfinished step.**
PRs #204–#209 (P-a through P-d, ADR 0016 Abstraction A) implemented the FlowDefinition →
enforcement bridge: P-a, a shared `src/lib/flow-resolver.ts` resolver
(`resolveActiveFlowStep`) that turns `(active_flow_id, active_step_id)` into a gate's
`expects[]`; P-b, declared-claim producers (`record-gate-claim` stamps kit-namespaced
claims per the active FlowDefinition's gate); P-c, gate enforcement in
`scripts/hooks/stop-goal-fit.js` reading `activeFlowStep.gateExpects[]` to select claims by
declared `claimType`; and P-d, `phase_map`-driven `advance-state --flow-definition` plus
retirement of the `-legacy` dual-emit shadow, so a live FlowDefinition-driven session emits
only kit-namespaced claims.

**It was then red-teamed in PR #215, which found the literal end-state unsafe.** The literal
Abstraction A text — declared-only enforcement, no `workflow.*` fallback — composed into a
HIGH-severity (OWASP A01/A04) gate-bypass chain: a forged `current.json` pointing at an
agent-authored `.flow.json` with an empty `expects: []` made the pure if/else selection logic
return `false` for every claim, silently skipping all re-derivation, tamper-detection, and
high/critical enforcement. PR #215 closed this by replacing the if/else with a **permanent
union-enforcement floor** — `workflow.*` claims are *always* enforced alongside whatever a
declared FlowDefinition adds, never instead of it — plus an empty-`expects[]`
`gate misconfiguration:` `HARD_BLOCK`. **This union floor and HARD_BLOCK are an intentional,
tested departure from Abstraction A's literal "instead of" wording, not an unfinished step
toward it, and must not be "completed" by removing them** (see ADR 0016 and ADR 0018, which
independently forbids adding new local `config-protection.js` patterns for this class of
vector and routes new self-tamper/kill-switch findings to Layer 4 instead).

**The one gap this left named and open — kit FlowDefinition files
(`kits/*/flows/*.flow.json`) had no CODEOWNERS coverage, so a narrowed-but-nonempty
`expects[]` edit had no owner-review trip-wire — is closed as of 2026-07-01, per ADR 0018
Decision #2** (a self-tamper/kill-switch vector routes to Layer 4 — CODEOWNERS + a required
regression test — not a new `config-protection.js` matcher). This closes the last open item
from this Reassessment's Phase 3; Phases 4–6 (resume/evals, retire sidecars, Flow kernel)
remain scoped as described above.

## Consequences

- **No bespoke trust-bundle schema validator in flow-agents.** Surface is the canonical
  owner; flow-agents delegates.
- **Stronger validation.** Surface also validates cross-reference integrity (dangling
  evidence/event references) that the hachure JSON schema did not. Bundles produced by
  `buildTrustBundle` are already reference-consistent, so no regression is possible in
  normal operation — only malformed external inputs are now additionally rejected.
- **async API.** `validateTrustBundle` is now async (returns `Promise<{valid,errors,available}>`).
  All existing call sites are in async contexts. External consumers of the library export
  must `await` the result.
- **Surface availability:** surface was already REQUIRED for bundle writes per ADR 0010 4c.
  `available: false` (fail-open) is only reachable in degraded diagnostic environments
  (e.g. `FLOW_AGENTS_SURFACE_UNAVAILABLE=1` test seam) or if surface fails to load.
